# gfabstract: Using bubbles and superbubbles to offer a lightweight datastructure, without compromising on graph structure

This implementation is purely theorical and experimental, and should not be used in development for now. Key idea is to allow loading and browsing of huge graphs by computing bubbles, and treating those as if they were a single node with multiple labels.
First implementation will be in Python. If we can forsee a usage of it, I might consider to take it to C/C++.

As per the rest of the project, feel free to contribute or open issues.
